// A function is a procedure of code that will run when called
// When written we can use it as many times as we please.
// We only write a function once
// Writing a function is known as function declaration or function definition

//  The example below declares a function named average and invokes it later on.
function average(number1, number2) {
  return (number1 + number1) / 2;
}
average();
