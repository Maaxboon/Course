// A function is a procedure of code that will run when called
// When written we can use it as many times as we please.
// We only write a function once
// Writing a function is known as function declaration or function definition

//  The example below declares a function named average and invokes it later on.

// Invoking or calling a function
/*Now that we've written a function how do we actually use it? Once defined a function can be invoked or called as many times as we please.

When we invoke or call a function, we specify the data for a function to use. When we specify what data to use for a function call, we refer to that process as passing arguments to the function. */
